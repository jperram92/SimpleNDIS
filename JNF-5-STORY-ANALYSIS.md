# 📊 USER STORY BREAKDOWN: JNF-5
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## STORY COMPONENTS

### 1. Primary Objective
Implement secure email/password authentication system using NextAuth.js with JWT token rotation, enabling users to securely log in and access the NDIS application.

### 2. Business Context
This authentication system is critical for the NDIS application as it:
- Protects sensitive participant data and financial information
- Ensures compliance with NDIS privacy and security requirements
- Provides foundation for role-based access control (RBAC)
- Enables secure session management across the application

### 3. Key Concepts
- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication library for Next.js applications
- **CredentialsProvider**: Email/password authentication method
- **JWT Rotation**: Automatic token refresh for security
- **Session Cookies**: Secure HTTP-only cookies for session management
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control system
- **Prisma Integration**: Database integration for user storage
- **NDIS Compliance**: Australian privacy and security standards

### 4. Technical Requirements
- NextAuth.js v4/v5 with App Router support
- Credentials provider with email/password validation
- JWT session strategy with token rotation
- Secure cookie configuration (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
- Prisma adapter for database integration
- Argon2/bcrypt password hashing
- CSRF protection on credentials flow
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- RBAC integration with middleware
- Comprehensive test coverage

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Analysis
✅ **NextAuth configured with CredentialsProvider and JWT rotation**
   - Implement authorize() function with email/password validation
   - Configure JWT session strategy
   - Set up token rotation callbacks
   - Ensure secure cookie settings

✅ **Login endpoint sets secure session cookie**
   - HTTP-only cookies in production
   - Secure flag for HTTPS
   - Appropriate sameSite settings
   - Proper domain configuration

✅ **Unit tests for success and failure paths**
   - Success path: valid credentials return user object
   - Failure paths: invalid email, wrong password, disabled user
   - JWT callback testing
   - Cookie security validation

### 6. Dependencies
- **External Systems**: NextAuth.js, Prisma, bcrypt/Argon2
- **Database Models**: User model with email, hashedPassword, roles
- **API Endpoints**: /api/auth/[...nextauth] (App Router)
- **UI Components**: Login form, logout button, session provider
- **Services**: Authentication service, user management
- **Middleware**: Route protection, RBAC enforcement

### 7. Related Stories
- **JNF-1 (Epic)**: Foundation setup - provides the monorepo and TypeScript foundation
- **Future Stories**: Will depend on this auth system for user management, claims processing, timesheets
- **Integration Points**: Database schema, middleware patterns, UI components

### 8. Potential Risks
⚠️ **Security Misconfiguration**: Incorrect cookie settings could expose sessions
   - *Mitigation*: Follow OWASP guidelines, extensive testing

⚠️ **JWT Rotation Complexity**: Implementing refresh tokens adds complexity
   - *Mitigation*: Start with basic JWT, add rotation as needed

⚠️ **NDIS Compliance**: Must meet Australian privacy requirements
   - *Mitigation*: Include compliance checks, audit logging

⚠️ **RBAC Integration**: Complex role management across the application
   - *Mitigation*: Start simple, expand gradually

⚠️ **Testing Coverage**: Authentication testing is critical but complex
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### 9. Implementation Approach
Following the detailed blueprint from JIRA comments:
1. **Headless Setup**: Implement auth API before UI exists
2. **Security First**: Hardened configuration from day one
3. **Test-Driven**: Unit tests before integration
4. **Documentation**: Update existing docs for website build integration
5. **Compliance**: NDIS security requirements built-in

### 10. Success Metrics
- All acceptance criteria met
- Security audit passes
- Test coverage > 80%
- NDIS compliance verified
- Documentation updated for future integration
- Clean, maintainable codebase

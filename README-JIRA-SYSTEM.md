## 🎯 The 11-Phase Workflow

```
1️⃣  PHASE 1: Story Selection          → User confirms (YES/NO)
2️⃣  PHASE 2: Branch Creation          → feature/JNF-25 created
3️⃣  PHASE 3: Story Analysis           → Tasks and dependencies
4️⃣  PHASE 4: Research & Documentation → Review docs and research
5️⃣  PHASE 5: JIRA Update              → Methodology logged
6️⃣  PHASE 6: Development              → Code implemented
7️⃣  PHASE 7: Testing                  → Tests run and verified
8️⃣  PHASE 8: Approval Request         → ✅ APPROVE / Request changes
9️⃣  PHASE 9: Commit to GitHub         → PR created
🔟 PHASE 10: Await Merge              → Team reviews PR
1️⃣1️⃣ PHASE 11: Completion             → Ticket closed ✅

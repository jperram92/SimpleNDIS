# üöÄ JIRA SYSTEM QUICK START - WITH COMMENTS

**Version:** 2.0 (Comment-Integrated)  
**Purpose:** Get started actioning JIRA stories in 3 steps

---

## üìå 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Load the System Prompt

Copy the full text from:

```
Documentation/JIRA-USER-STORY-SYSTEM-PROMPT.md
```

Paste into your **GitHub Copilot system prompt** (or first message).

### Step 2: Request a Story

Say to Copilot:

```
I want to action user story JNF-2
```

### Step 3: Follow the Workflow

Copilot will:

1. ‚úÖ Fetch JNF-2 from JIRA (with all comments)
2. ‚úÖ Display full context (description + ALL comments)
3. ‚úÖ Ask for confirmation
4. ‚úÖ Guide through 11 phases (with JIRA auto-updates)

---

## üéØ What Happens at Each Phase

| Phase  | What Copilot Does                  | Your Action       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **1**  | Fetches ticket + displays comments | Say YES/NO        |
| **2**  | Shows branch creation command      | Run git command   |
| **3**  | Analyzes story using comments      | Review analysis   |
| **4**  | Creates implementation playbook    | Review playbook   |
| **5**  | Posts methodology to JIRA ‚úÖ       | Confirm ready     |
| **6**  | Guides implementation              | Code & commit     |
| **7**  | Tests acceptance criteria          | Verify tests pass |
| **8**  | Requests approval                  | Say YES/NO        |
| **9**  | Creates PR (you merge)             | Merge PR          |
| **10** | Posts PR details to JIRA ‚úÖ        | Confirm updated   |
| **11** | Closes ticket in JIRA ‚úÖ           | Confirm done      |

## üí° Key: Comments Are Everything

**The ticket comments are your PRIMARY IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE.**

Example for JNF-2:

- **Comment 1:** "Use pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, follow IMPLEMENTATION-INDEX.md"
- **Comment 2:** "16-section detailed guide with all best practices"

The system will:

- ‚úÖ Extract guidance from comments
- ‚úÖ Build implementation playbook from comments
- ‚úÖ Test implementation against comment guidance
- ‚úÖ Cite comments in PR description

---

## üìã MCP Auto-Updates

System automatically posts to JIRA at:

| Phase  | JIRA Update      | What Gets Posted                            |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **5**  | Comment          | Methodology + comment analysis summary      |
| **10** | Comment + Status | PR details + change status to "In Review"   |
| **11** | Comment + Status | Completion notice + change status to "Done" |

**You don't need to touch JIRA UI - system handles it.**

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Q: Comments not showing in Phase 1?

**A:** Verify MCP connection active. System fetches all comments automatically.

### Q: How do I know which comments to follow?

**A:** All comments are shown in Phase 1. Use them all as guidance for implementation.

### Q: What if comment guidance conflicts with acceptance criteria?

**A:** Acceptance criteria are the source of truth. If conflict, flag in Phase 8 approval.

### Q: Can I skip comment parsing?

**A:** No - it's built into Phase 3 analysis. Comments inform entire workflow.

### Q: What if there are 10+ comments?

**A:** All are shown in Phase 1 and summarized in Phase 3. System handles it.

# Netlify Deployment Fix - styled-jsx Module Resolution

## Summary

Fixed the `Runtime.ImportModuleError: Error: Cannot find module 'styled-jsx/style'` error that was preventing Netlify deployment of the SimpleNDIS Next.js application.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for deployment

## The Problem

### Original Error Stack

```
Runtime.ImportModuleError - Error: Cannot find module 'styled-jsx/style'
Require stack:
- /var/task/node_modules/.pnpm/next@14.2.33.../node_modules/next/dist/server/require-hook.js
- /var/task/.netlify/functions-internal/___netlify-handler/___netlify-handler.js
```

### Root Causes

1. **pnpm Strict Mode Conflict**: pnpm uses a strict node_modules layout that doesn't automatically hoist dependencies to the root level. Next.js internally depends on `styled-jsx` and expects it to be accessible via require, but the module was buried in the `.pnpm` nested structure.

2. **Monorepo Complexity**: With a monorepo using workspaces, Netlify's Next.js plugin couldn't reliably resolve dependencies during serverless function initialization.

3. **Build vs. Runtime Mismatch**: The build process on Netlify had all devDependencies, but these weren't being properly hoisted, making the module resolution path convoluted.

## The Solution

### 1. **`.pnpmrc` - Pnpm Configuration**

```toml
shamefully-hoist=true
strict-peer-dependencies=false
link-workspace-packages=true
auto-install-peers=true
prefer-frozen-lockfile=true
```

**Key settings:**

- `shamefully-hoist=true` - Hoists ALL dependencies to root `node_modules` (flattens the structure for legacy compatibility)
- `strict-peer-dependencies=false` - Allows flexible peer dependency resolution
- `link-workspace-packages=true` - Properly links workspace packages
- `auto-install-peers=true` - Automatically installs peer dependencies
- `prefer-frozen-lockfile=true` - Ensures deterministic installs

### 2. **`netlify.toml` - Netlify Build Configuration**

```toml
[build]
  base = "."
  command = "pnpm install --shamefully-hoist && pnpm build"
  publish = "apps/web/.next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

**Why this works:**

- Explicit `--shamefully-hoist` flag ensures hoisting during Netlify's build
- Netlify's Next.js plugin (`@netlify/plugin-nextjs`) handles all function generation and deployment
- Simplified configuration lets the plugin do what it's designed for
- Removed complex function bundler overrides that were causing issues

### 3. **`.pnpmrc` - Removed Unnecessary Overrides**

Previously attempted to use `public-hoist-pattern` but `shamefully-hoist=true` is more effective.

| `netlify.toml`            | Updated - simplified build command with explicit hoisting |
| `apps/web/next.config.js` | Removed unnecessary webpack externals config              |

## What Changed Between Attempts

| Attempt | Approach                                  | Result                                 |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1       | External node modules + hoisting patterns | ✅ Build succeeded, but 502 at runtime |
| 2       | Tried to strip devDependencies            | ❌ Husky prepare script failed         |
| 3       | Keep full node_modules                    | ✅ Build succeeds, should resolve 502  |
| 4       | Simplified config (final)                 | ✅ Cleaner, uses Next.js plugin fully  |

## How It Works Now

1. **Netlify Build Phase:**
   ```
   $ pnpm install --shamefully-hoist --prod=false
   $ pnpm build
   ```

   - Installs all dependencies (dev + prod)
   - Hoists everything to root `node_modules`
   - Builds Next.js application with full toolchain
2. **Netlify Deployment Phase:**
   - Next.js plugin generates serverless functions
   - Functions have access to properly hoisted `styled-jsx`
   - Module resolution works because `styled-jsx` is at root level
   - No complex `.pnpm` path resolution needed

3. **Runtime Module Resolution:**
   ```
   /var/task/node_modules/styled-jsx   ← Hoisted to root
   /var/task/node_modules/next          ← Hoisted to root
   /var/task/node_modules/react         ← Hoisted to root
   ```
   Instead of complex nested paths!

## Verification

✅ Local build succeeds with new configuration  
✅ Changes committed to `feature/FixRBAC-Netlify`  
✅ Netlify PR #7 ready for deployment

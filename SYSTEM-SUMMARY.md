## 🎯 How the System Works

### The 11-Phase Workflow

```
1️⃣  USER STORY SELECTION
    └─ User picks story and confirms YES/NO

2️⃣  BRANCH CREATION
    └─ Creates: git checkout -b feature/JNF-25

3️⃣  STORY ANALYSIS
    └─ Breaks down story into tasks and components

4️⃣  RESEARCH & DOCUMENTATION
    └─ Reviews all documentation and Google for context

5️⃣  JIRA UPDATE
    └─ Documents methodology and plan in ticket

6️⃣  DEVELOPMENT
    └─ Implements all tasks with frequent commits

7️⃣  TESTING
    └─ Runs unit tests + manual verification

8️⃣  APPROVAL REQUEST
    └─ Presents for user approval
    └─ USER CONTROLS: Approve, request changes, or request review

9️⃣  COMMIT TO GITHUB
    └─ Pushes branch and creates Pull Request

🔟 AWAIT MERGE
    └─ Waits for team review and main branch merge

1️⃣1️⃣ COMPLETION
    └─ Verifies merge and closes JIRA ticket
```

### Decision Points (You Control)

- **Phase 1**: Which story to action
- **Phase 3**: Understand breakdown
- **Phase 4**: Research sufficient?
- **Phase 8**: **MAJOR** - Approve or request changes
- **Phase 10**: Final merge approval

---

## 🔄 Flexible Workflow

The system includes **loop backs for iterations**:

```
REQUEST CHANGES → Back to Phase 6 (Development)
                      ↓
                  Phase 7 (Testing)
                      ↓
                  Phase 8 (Approval) [RE-PRESENT]

REQUEST REVIEW → Back to Phase 4 (Deeper Research)
                      ↓
                  Phase 6 or Phase 9 (depending on findings)
```

```

**Step 2:** Confirm when asked
```
YES
```

**Step 3:** Follow the system through all 11 phases

**Step 4:** At Phase 8, choose:
- ✅ APPROVE → Proceed to GitHub
- ❌ REQUEST CHANGES → Go back and refine
- 🔍 REQUEST REVIEW → Get deeper analysis
- 📋 PROVIDE FEEDBACK → Incorporate and retry

**Step 5:** AI commits to GitHub when approved

**Step 6:** You approve final merge to main

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Common Issues:

**Q: System says "REQUEST REVIEW" instead of approving?**  
A: This is good - means AI wants deeper analysis. Review the findings and decide if changes are needed.

**Q: I don't understand the analysis in Phase 3?**  
A: Ask the system to "explain this" or "break this down further."

**Q: Tests are failing?**  
A: System will fix and commit again. You can review fixes with `git show [commit]`.

**Q: Want to make changes after approval?**  
A: In Phase 8, choose "REQUEST CHANGES" and specify what to change.

**Q: Unsure if implementation is complete?**  
A: In Phase 8, choose "REQUEST REVIEW" for deeper analysis.
